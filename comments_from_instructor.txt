COMMENTS FROM THE INSTRUCTOR:

Such nice work on this project, and your PlaylistTester.java works
perfectly! Congratulations!

Your .gitignore file wasn't ignoring the .ctxt and .class files, so
I updated that file and you shouldn't be bothered by testing in
the future.

I've done a couple of commits on this project, including one in which
this comment file has been added.

Great work on this project you two!

SCORE: 20/20
